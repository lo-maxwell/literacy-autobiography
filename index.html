    <h1>Learning to code </h1>
    <p>My name is Maxwell Lo. I’m a junior transfer studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley (with an emphasis on the CS part). Actually, I’m not particularly interested in electrical engineering. I mostly applied to this major so that I would be guaranteed the CS side without having to take a bunch of intro to computer science courses and praying for a 3.3+ GPA. 
    </p>
    <p>Programming is a powerful tool that allows me to create whatever I want, whenever I want, as long as I have the time and effort to spare. All it takes is a computer and a bit of imagination. Most of all, it feels rewarding to have immediate feedback during the creation process. If a webpage appears broken or an element is out of place, I can quickly isolate the problem and fix it without having to redo the whole thing. 
    </p>
    <p>Of course, it’s not always that easy. It took me many years of work to get to the point where I feel comfortable creating my own projects without a guide, and even now I’ll sometimes run into problems that leave me bashing my head against a wall.

    <p>But when my program finally runs, I immediately forget about all the troubles that came up along the way. To me, the act of solving a particularly hard problem that I had been struggling with for hours is the most rewarding feeling in the world.
    </p>

    <p>My first exposure to computer science was at a summer camp in 6th grade. We learned a programming language called Scratch, which was a highly visual and block-based language. By piecing together various blocks, one could make the 2D cat walk, jump, or flip upside down. To 6th-grade me, this was incredibly entertaining. I loved the idea of being able to play around with what were essentially legos to make something move on the screen according to my will.

    </figure>
    <p>Programming was an entirely new concept to me, an entirely new literacy disconnected from my previous knowledge of academic reading and writing. If anything, the building blocks that I pieced together to form instructions for the computer were closer to a math formula that I had to come up with on the spot. In the words of David Kirkland, “...literacy suggests much more than the ability to deliberately manipulate texts for the purposes of social participation and meaning-making. In this case, it implies a potential to make meaning and an opportunity to comment on one’s realities through a symbol system that uses more than words” (376). By learning Scratch, I gained the ability to pull ideas from my imagination onto the computer screen. It gave me the opportunity to express my thoughts in a concrete setting that others could look at, comment on, or play with. 
    </p>
    <p>Every weekday, I looked forward to the 1.5 hour session during which I could learn new features, develop more complex programs, and just generally mess around with code. By the end of the summer, I had created a multitude of games and art pieces in Scratch. It hadn’t felt like hard work at all -- rather, it was the product of just playing around for 90 minutes a day and having a general goal of “make something while having fun”.

    </figure>
    
    <p>At the end of the course, my instructor recommended that anyone who liked learning Scratch either continue with it on their own, or move up into a more complicated programming language such as Java. I had already reached what I thought were the limits of Scratch, and decided that if I wanted to make something really cool, I would need more powerful tools. 
    </p>
    <p>As it turned out, learning Java is really hard for a middle schooler.
    </p>
  <br>
    <p>I thought the best way to learn would be to find some online tutorials and follow them to the letter. I found an online, self-paced “Learn Java in 30 days!” type of course, and for a few days, I sat there with a pen in hand, taking notes as the lecturer droned on and on about applications, algorithms, environments, variables, arrays, lists, integers, floats, booleans, declaration, initialization, assignment, loops, recursion, classes, objects, functions, constructors, inheritance, overloading... I had a list of words and their definitions, but no concrete understanding of how to use them. 
    </p>

    <p>Paulo Freire describes this as a “banking education”, where “Education thus becomes an act of depositing, in which the students are the depositories and the teacher is the depositor. Instead of communicating, the teacher issues communiqués and makes deposits which the students patiently receive, memorize, and repeat... it is the people themselves who are filed away through the lack of creativity, transformation, and knowledge in this (at best) misguided system” (72). Looking back, I had misconstrued the act of learning with simple memorization. I had become a depository that lacked the ability to make meaning with the knowledge that I had gained. 
    </p>
    <p>A side effect of this was that I was slowly losing the ability to keep up with the video lectures. In the beginning it mostly made sense, when I could still rely on my limited programming experience to understand what was going on. But as the days went by, I found myself having to slow down the video, rewind it to listen more carefully about how to use some keyword, and even then I didn’t get the meaning. A 20-minute lecture would take me two to three times as long to finish, and by the end I was frustrated with myself for being so slow and still not fully understanding the material, just knowing enough that I could say to myself, “It’ll make sense when I use it in the next chapter”. 
    </p>
    <p>Spoiler: It didn’t make sense in the next chapter, either. 
    </p>
    <p>I was used to studying being easy. I was consistently at the top of my class, and classmates would often come to me for help. This resulted in a boy who may have been slightly smarter and faster-learning than his peers, but with no study skills and pride that made it impossible to ask for help. I thought that not being able to learn how to program meant that there was something wrong with me, and I didn’t want to get assistance from someone else and risk them finding out that I wasn’t academically perfect. 
    </p>
    <p>The end result? I quit.
    </p>

    <p>In my junior year of high school, my friend convinced me to take AP Computer Science with him. While I didn’t have high expectations for the content, I thought it might be an okay class to take to mess around on a computer for an hour a day. The teacher was known for being rather nice, and all the homework was optional provided one completed classwork in a somewhat timely manner. 
    </p>
    <p>The teaching style was a complete 180 from what I had been doing. Every new vocabulary word was followed up by an example or problem to solve that would cement its usage in my mind, and every example was used in a larger project that we would work on in class. Even if I didn’t understand something at first glance, there were people around me who could help.  
    </p>

    <p>Lev Vygotsky writes, “...the zone of proximal development… is the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers” (9). The idea of scaffolding, where peers and teachers assist the student in completing more complex tasks, is deeply tied into this. I wasn’t going at it alone--there was an entire class full of students that I could talk to, as well as the teacher, if I had trouble with a concept. For the first time since my 6th grade summer camp, I was thinking, I was understanding, I was having fun creating programs, and I had other people around me to talk about it with.
    </p>

    <p>After graduating high school, I studied computer science at the City College of San Francisco, making apps and games along the way. I was surprised that I was actually able to get into Cal as an EECS major, but now that I’m here, I plan to develop my programming abilities as much as I can. To me, programming is not just a skill, it is another literacy that I have access to. Of course there are the direct things like being able to read code, reverse engineer applications, or communicate with other programmers, but it also gives me the ability to create programs that even people who are not literate in programming can utilize. Although it wasn’t an easy path, I’m happy with the result.
